		<h2>What is Phobia?</h2>
		<hr color="#16a085"/>
		
		<p style="text-align:justify;font-size:18px">Phobias are a very common type of <strong style="color:red">anxiety disorder</strong>. Broadly speaking, the definition of phobia is: Unreasonable fear and anxiety around a specific object or situation, generally causing its complete avoidance.
		Phobic disorders are the most common type of mental illness – more common than even depression. <strong>Social phobia</strong> is a common type of anxiety disorder. The effects of a phobia can range from minor and annoying to severe and debilitating.
		A person with a phobia may avoid an object, such as snakes, or be compelled to avoid situations, like all social events or events involving crowds. A person with a severe phobia can end up with a life dictated by avoiding the objects or situations they fear. This can impact their ability to make friends or keep a job.
		There are several theories as to the causes of phobias; however, no cause has yet conclusively been identified. The cause of phobias likely also varies depending on the type of phobia. Phobias, very commonly, occur alongside other anxiety disorders including other phobias.</p>

		<h2>What is panic disorder?</h2>
		<hr color="#16a085"/>
		
		<p style="text-align: justify;font-size: 18px">
		Panic disorder involves repeated and unexpected panic attacks. A panic attack is a feeling of intense fear or terror that lasts for a short period of time. It involves physical sensations like a racing heart, shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness, shaking, sweating or nausea. Some people feel like they’re having a heart attack or suffocating, or fear that they are dying. However, a panic attack goes away on its own. <br>

        Panic attacks can be a normal reaction to a stressful situation or a part of another mental illness. With panic disorder, panic attacks seem to happen for no reason. People who experience panic disorder fear more panic attacks and may worry that something bad will happen as a result of the panic attack. They may avoid places, sensations, or activities that remind them of a panic attack.

        Some people avoid any situation where they can’t escape or find help. They may avoid public places or even avoid leaving their home. This is called agoraphobia.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Counselling and support</h2>
		<hr color="#16a085"/>
		
		<p style="text-align: justify;font-size: 18px">
		    Counselling can be very helpful in managing anxiety, and it’s often the first treatment to try if you experience mild or moderate problems. <strong>Cognitive-behavioural therapy</strong> (or ‘CBT’) is shown to be effective for many anxiety problems. CBT teaches you how thoughts, feelings and behaviours all work together. Counselling for panic disorder and phobias, in particular, may also include exposure. Exposure slowly introduces feared things or situations. <br>

            Support groups may be a good way to share your experiences, learn from others, and connect with people who understand what you’re experiencing.

            There are many self-help strategies to try at home. Small steps like eating well, exercising regularly, and practicing healthy sleep habits can really help. You can practice many CBT skills, like problem-solving and challenging anxious thoughts, on your own. Ask your support team about community organizations, websites, or books that teach CBT skills. And it’s always important to spend time on activities you enjoy and connect with loved ones.

		<h2>Medication</h2>
		<hr color="#16a085"/>
		
		<p style="text-align: justify;font-size: 18px">
		    Antianxiety medication may help for short-term difficulties or situations, but it usually isn’t the best option for long-term use. Some types of antidepressants can help with anxiety, and they can be used for longer periods of time. It’s important to remember that medications can’t change all of the thoughts, feelings, and behaviours that drive anxiety, so counselling is usually recommended. Some people take medication until their anxiety is controlled enough to start counselling.
